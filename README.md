This repo contains the `api-documenter` package, which is copied from `@microsoft/rushstack`.

We modify this slightly, so that we can get a Docusaurus-compatible output. There's a few hard-coded values, and some other stuff, which will likely frevent you from using this.

If you're trying to use the original Api-Documenter together with Docusaurus, then maybe this can inspire you :)
